        Scene I: At the last hour before dawn.

        [Enter The Ghost and Guildenstern]

        The Ghost:
        You pretty little warm thing! Thou art as prompt as the difference
        between the square of thyself and your golden hair. Speak your mind.

        Guildenstern:
        Listen to your heart!

        [Exit The Ghost]

        Guildenstern:
        Is the modulus of Rosencrantz and me as good as
        nothing?

        Hamlet:
        If so, let us proceed to scene IV.
        Thou art as bold as the sum of thyself and a roman.

        Rosencrantz:
        Thou art as rotten as the difference between nothing and the sum of a
        snotty stinking half witted hog and a small toad!
        Speak your mind!
