        Act I: The one and only.

        Scene I: In the beginning, there was nothing.

        [Enter Hamlet and Polonius]

        Hamlet:
        You are nothing!

        Scene II: Pushing to the very end.

        Polonius:
        Open your mind! Remember yourself.

        Hamlet:
        You are as hard as the sum of yourself and a stone wall. Am I as
        horrid as the square of a filthy hairy evil devil?

        Polonius:
        If not, let us return to scene II. Recall your imminent death!

        Hamlet:
        You are as small as the difference between yourself and a hair!

        Scene III: Popping!

        Polonius:
        Recall your unhappy childhood. Speak your mind!

        Hamlet:
        You are as vile as the sum of yourself and a toad! Are you better
        than nothing?

        Polonius:
        If so, let us return to scene III.

        Scene IV: The end.

        [Exeunt]
